# Introduction to Running Jobs on Comet Supercomputer

Presented by Mary Thomas (SDSC,  <mpthomas@ucsd.edu> )
<hr>
In this tutorial, you will learn how to compile and run jobs on Comet, where to run them, and how to run batch jobs.
The commands below can be cut & pasted into the terminal window, which is connected to comet.sdsc.edu. For instructions on how to do this, see the tutorial on how to use a terminal application and SSH go connect to an SDSC HPC system: https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training/basic_skills/tree/master/connecting_to_hpc_systems.


# Misc Notes/Updates:
* You must have a comet account in order to access the system.
    * To obtain a trial account:  http://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/comet.html#trial_accounts
* You must be familiar with running basic Unix commands: see the following tutorials at:
    * https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training/basic_skills
* The `hostname` for Comet is `comet.sdsc.edu`
* The operating system for Comet was changed to CentOS in December, 2019. As a result, you will need to recompile all code, some modules and libraries are no longer needed, and the locations of some libraries and applications have changed. For details, see the transition guide here:
   * https://www.sdsc.edu/services/hpc/comet_upgrade.html
* Our next HPC system, [E X P A N S E](https://expanse.sdsc.edu), will be coming online for early users in September. Keep an eye on the E X P A N S E pages for training information and other updates
