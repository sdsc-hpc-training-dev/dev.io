You can access a jupyter notebook directly from your browser after starting it on the login node. This method is insecure, and will result in a notebook served over http, which is not something you want to be using on a regular basis.</p>

<h2 id="access-the-node-in-your-browser">Access the node in your browser</h2>
<p>Copy the the URL above into the browser running on your laptop.</p>
